# Developer Guide

## Design & Implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}


## Product Scope
### Target user profile

Our target audiences are professors who need help organizing their personal work schedule and need more time.
The professors are pressed for time and they require a simple software to organize their monthly events
and keep track of their students' attendance and performance. 


### Value proposition

Our application will reduce the stress of the professor by allowing them to easily enter and store
their work schedule as well as their students' records. After storing the data, the Professor can have
quick access to the information in either a list or a calendar view.
