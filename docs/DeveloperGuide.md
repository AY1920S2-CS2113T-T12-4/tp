## 2. Design

### 2.1 Overall Architecture
This section presents the architecture of PAC. It explains the architecture of main components of PAC.

![Architecture](images/Architecture.png "Architecture of Pac")              
*Overall architecture design of Pac*

The `Pac` component contains all other components in the application.

- `UI`: reads user input, and prints output in pre-defined format.
- `Storage`: loads/stores all events (in EventList) and all student lists (in StudentListCollection).
- `CommandInterpreter`: Determines category and type of command from user input.
- Various `Parser`: Breaks down user input to obtain command parameters.
- Various `Features`: stores their respective objects during runtime.
    - `EventList`: stores all events during runtime.
    - `StudentListCollection`: stores all student lists during runtime.
    - `AttendanceList`: stores all attendances related to an `Event`.
    - `PerformanceList`: stores all performances related to an `Event`.
    - `Calendar`: shows all events in calendar form.

### 2.2 UI component
![Ui](images/Ui.png "Class diagram of Ui component")                
*Class diagram of the UI component*   

UI is the main class handles user display, which includes reading user input and printing information 
back to the user on command-line.  
Besides the normal command line messages, there are two subclasses of UI: 
DisplayList and DisplayTable, to specifically print the list and table interface to professor. 

### 2.3 Command component
![Command](images/Command.png "Class diagram of Command component")         
*Class diagram of the Command component*  

Commands are the main classes to be executed in Pac. All of the specific Command classes inherit the 
base Command abstract class, and utilize its abstract execute() method.  
A subclass of Command is created and executed when the professor input a corresponding command.

### 2.4 Parser component
*Class diagram of the Parser component*  
There are total of four Parser classes as shown below. Each Parser class correspond to a feature 
of Pac. 

| Parser                    | Created in                                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| EventParser               | EventCommandInterpreter                                       | 
| CalenderParser            | EventCommandInterpreter                                       | 
| PerformanceParser         | Step-by-step command at performance-related command classes   |  
| AttendanceParser          | Step-by-step command at attendance-related command classes    |  

A Parser class is created when a user input contains data to be stored or used in certain features.    

### 2.5 Storage component
![Storage](images/StorageClass.png "Class diagram of Storage component")            
*Class diagram of the Storage component*

On startup, `Pac` instantiates two `Storage` objects (`eventStorage` and 
`studentListStorage`) to load and save `Event` and `StudentList` objects respectively.

All `Event` and `StudentList` objects are receiving `Bye` command. If the 
program crashes (due to unhandled Exception or Interrupt), they *will not* be 
saved.

### 2.6 Command Interpreter component
![CommandInterpreter](images/CommandInterpreter.png)   
*to be added: Sequence diagram of Command Interpreter*  
Command Interpreter is the main interpreter in Pac. It determines which command 
category the user input belongs to, and creates respective command interpreter 
correspond to user input.  
The user input will be further interpreted by corresponding command interpreter, which
returns Command for execution.  

#### 2.6.1 Event Command Interpreter
#### 2.6.2 Attendance Command Interpreter
#### 2.6.3 Performance Command Interpreter
Performance Command Interpreter interprets the user input when it belongs to the
performance category. 
When user input is passed to Performance Command Interpreter, it extracts the 
second word in the user input and decides whether that string can be interpreted to a
valid Command. If valid, the interpreter returns its corresponding Command. 
If invalid, the interpreter throws PacException to inform the user. 
Below shows the flow chart and sequence diagram of 
Performance Command Interpreter.  
![Flow chart](images/PerformanceCommandInterpreterFlowChart.png)  
*Flow Chart of Performance Command Interpreter*  
![Sequence diagram](images/PerformanceCommandInterpreterSequenceDiagram.png) 
*Sequence diagram of Performance Command Interpreter*  

#### 2.6.4 Seminar Command Interpreter
#### 2.6.5 Student Command Interpreter

## 3. Implementation  
### 3.1 Event
![event](images/Event.png "Class diagram of Event component")               
*Class diagram of the Event component*

#### Program flow
1. When a user enters an event-related command, the command is analysed by `EventCommandInterpreter`. 
1. The first word is extracted by `getFirstWord` to determine the `commandType`.
1. If this `commandType` requires further arguments, subsequent words are 
extracted, and parsed by `EventParser` to retrieve the relevant information 
(e.g. index, name, time, date, venue).
1. Alternate paths are chosen based on `commandType`, where a corresponding 
`Command` class is created, with the information extracted from the previous 
step passed into it. 
    - e.g. Command `event delete i/1` will create a `DeleteEvent` object, with 
    `index=1` as its argument.
1. This command is returned to `CommandInterpreter#decideCommand()` which returns to `Pac#run()` to call `Command#execute()`. 

The diagram below illustrates the program flow stated above, with the command 
`event delete i/1`.
![event sequence](images/EventSequence.png "Sequence diagram of event delete i/1")

In this diagram:
* Other alternative paths are not shown (e.g. [add], [editEvent], [list], etc.).
* The details after `Command#execute()` is not shown.

Note that:
* `datetime` is stored as a single attribute in `Event` class, but it is exposed to user as `date` 
and `time`, which corresponds to `d/` and `t/` flag respectively.
* `editDate` or `editTime` commands are not available. Only `editDateTime` is available to change the 
`date` and/or `time` of an `Event` object.
* `delete(Event)` method is currently not in use, but can be used to implement delete by event name, 
either by complete match, or fuzzy match.
* Any classes (e.g. `Seminar`) that inherit from `Event` class will have similar program flow. 

### 3.2 Attendance
![attendance](images/Attendance.png "Class diagram of Attendance component")        
*Class diagram of the Attendance component*

#### Program flow
1. When a user enters an attendance-related command, the command is analysed by `AttendanceCommandInterpreter`. 
1. Once determined, the relevant class that corresponds to the type of command is created.
1. Then, the class will execute base on its function. It modifies `AttendanceList`.
1. These commands are then returned to `Pac.run()` to `execute()`. 

Note that:
* `attendance add` command requires a line-by-line insertion of the student attendance data. 
The user is given an option to either use an existing list stored under StudentListCollection or
create a new attendance list. `n/` and `p/` flags are used to insert new attendance.

### 3.3 Calendar
*Figure 2: Class diagram of the Calendar component*

#### Program flow
1. When a user enters a calendar-related command, the command is analysed by `CalendarCommandInterpreter`.
1. Once determined, the relevant information (eg. semester, academic year) are extracted by `CalendarParser`.
1. Then, either AddFirstSemester or AddSecondSemester class that corresponds the semester number is created. 
1. Subsequently, it separates events by the required month and year in `CalendarList`
1. These commands are then returned to `Pac.run()` to `execute()`. 

Note that:
* `acadamic year` is parsed into corresponding to only one year according to the semester in `EventParser` class.
* Calendar view of the whole year is not available. Only semester 1 or 2 of an academic year can be viewed at a time.
* Event name size must be less than 10 characters to be displayed neatly (current implementation), however
it can be implement to truncate longer names to fit nicely

### 3.4 Performance
![Performance](images/Performance.png)
*Class diagram of the Performance component*  

#### Program flow
1. When a user enters a performance-related command, the command is analysed by 
[PerformanceCommandInterpreter](#263-performance-command-interpreter). 
1. Once determined, the relevant class that corresponds to the command is created (e.g. AddPerformance, 
DeletePerformance...), and ask for relevant information (e.g. event name, student name, student result) from the user. 
1. Then, with the information extracted from the previous step passed into it. It modifies PerformanceList` under
the event class correspond to the input event name.
1. These commands are then returned to `Pac.run()` to `execute()`. 

Note that:
* All PerformanceList class are created under an Event. A PerformanceList cannot exist 
by its own. 
* All Performance commands are step-by-step commands. This aims to provide convenience to the user by 
prompting instructions and correct command format.  

#### Features under Performance
There are 5 features for performance in total, as shown below. 
The features will be presented in the order of sequence diagram, followed by description.  
 
1. Add performanceList
![AddPerformance](images/AddPerformance.png)
*Sequence diagram of AddPerformanceList*  
AddPerformanceList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to add performances
by importing a student list, or add manually, to a desired performance list under an Event.    
The method execute() calls addToList() from the same class, which then calls 
isImportList() from UI to get a user input. This user input decides whether 
the user will add performances by list or manually. 
The method addByList() or addManually() will then get user input for Performance parameters, 
which will be parsed by the PerformanceParser and return a Performance.  
The Performance attained from the parser will be added to a desired performanceList. 

1. Delete performanceList
![DeletePerformance](images/DeletePerformance.png)
*Sequence diagram of AddPerformance*  
DeletePerformanceList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to delete a performance
from a desired performance list under an Event.  
The method execute() calls deletePerformance() from the same class, which then calls 
getPerformance() from itself to get the user input, Performance parameters 
of the Performance to be deleted, and return a Performance.  
The Performance attained from getPerformance() will be deleted from a desired performanceList. 

1. Edit performanceList
![EditPerformance](images/EditPerformance.png)
*Sequence diagram of EditPerformance*  
EditPerformanceList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to edit a performance,
either the student's name or result, from a desired performance list under an Event.  
The method execute() calls editPerformanceList() from the same class, which then calls 
getPerformance() from itself, to get the user input, student's name of the 
Performance to be edited, and return a Performance.  
The method editPerformanceList() then calls getPerformanceParameter() from UI 
to get a user input. This user input decides whether the user will edit the 
student's name or result.  
The new parameter will be attained from the user in method editPerformance(performance, editType) 
in PerformanceList.  

1. Sort performanceList
    1. ![SortPerformanceByName](images/SortPerformanceList.png)
    *Sequence diagram of SortPerformanceListByName*  
    
    1. ![SortPerformanceByResult](images/SortPerformanceListByResult.png)
    *Sequence diagram of SortPerformanceListByResult*  
SortPerformanceListByName and SortPerformanceListByResult are subclasses of Command. 
They both allow the user to sort a performance list, by student's name or result as their
name suggest. 
The two Commands are discussed together in this section as they have similar behaviour.  
The method execute() calls sortPerformanceByName() or sortPerformanceByResult, 
according to its class name.   
The methods sortPerformanceBy...() access a desired performanceList and check whether 
the list is empty. 
If empty, it calls display() in UI and inform the user.  
Else, it will sort the performanceList by the type mentioned in its method name.  

1. View performanceList  
![ViewPerformance](images/ViewPerformanceList.png)
*Sequence diagram of ViewPerformanceList*  
ViewPerformanceList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to view a self
generated table based on the data in a desired performance list.  
The method execute() calls viewList() from the same class, which accesses a 
desired performanceList of given event and checks whether that list is empty.  
If empty, viewList() calls display() in UI and inform the user.  
Else, it will iterate through the performanceList and print Performance 
data in a table format.  

### 3.5 Student List Collection
![Student](images/Student.png "Class diagram of Student component")     
*Class diagram of the Student component*  
1. When a user enters an studentList-related command, the command is analysed by `StudentCommandInterpreter`. 
1. Once determined, the relevant class that corresponds to the type of command is created.
1. Then, the class will execute base on its function. It modifies `AttendanceList`.
1. These commands are then returned to `Pac.run()` to `execute()`. 

Note that:
* studentList-related commands can be executed without the existence of events.

* *flag* - anything that takes the form of  `?/`, e.g. `n/`, `i/`  

1. Add student list
![AddStudentList](images/addStudentList.png)  
 *Sequence diagram of AddStudentList*   
AddStudentList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to add a student list
to the studentListCollection.    
The method execute() calls addToList() from the same class, which then calls 
getListName() from UI to get a user input for listName.  
The list name of student list is restricted to one word only, hence the parameter listName 
is trimmed.  
StudentList, a new student list is created with list name listName.  
The method addToList() calls addStudent(studentList) from UI to get user input 
for student names to be added. The names are added to studentList
in addStudent(studentList).  
After user has done input, studentList will be printed, and this new list is
added to studentListCollection.
 
1. Delete student list  
![DeleteStudentList](images/DeleteStudentList.png)  
 *Sequence diagram of DeleteStudentList*  
DeleteStudentList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to delete a student list
from the studentListCollection.    
If the studentListCollection is empty, execute() calls displayStudentListCollectionEmpty()
form UI, to inform the user.  
Else, it calls deleteFromExisting() from the same class and get user input for index, the
list number to be deleted.  
The (index-1)th list in studentListCollection is deleted.  

1. Clear student list  
![ClearStudentList](images/ClearStudentList.png)  
 *Sequence diagram of ClearStudentList*  
ClearStudentList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to clear the 
studentListCollection.  
The method execute() calls clear() from the same class. 
If the studentListCollection is empty, clear() calls displayStudentListCollectionEmpty()
from UI, to inform the user.  
Else, it calls clear() from StudentListCollection to clear the collection. 
The user will get informed when a success clear has been performed. 

1. View student list  
![ViewStudentList](images/ViewStudentList.png)  
 *Sequence diagram of ViewStudentList*   
ViewStudentList is a subclass of Command. It allows the user to view a self 
generated table based on the data in studentListCollection.  
The method execute() calls displayStudentList() from the same class. 
If the studentListCollection is empty, displayStudentList() calls 
displayStudentListCollectionEmpty() from UI, to inform the user.  
Else, it calls printStudentListCollection() from UI to print the table. 

1. Edit student list




### 3.6 Help
![Help](images/Help.png)  
*Sequence diagram for Help*  
Help function provides a summary of command format for the user.  
When help command is executed, a menu page is shown at the console. 
It then calls getStringInput() from UI, to get user input, typeOfHelp, and prints
corresponding help information to user.  

## Appendix

### Appendix A: Target user profile
Our target audiences are professors who need help organizing their personal work schedule and need more time.
The professors are pressed for time and they require a simple software to organize their monthly events
and keep track of their students' attendance and performance. 

### Appendix B: Value proposition
Our application will reduce the stress of the professor by allowing them to easily enter and store
their work schedule as well as their students' records. After storing the data, the Professor can have
quick access to the information in either a list or a calendar view. 

## Appendix C: Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has 
[Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or above installed.
1. Should be able to hold up to 100 events without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for 
typical usage.
1. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not 
system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands 
than using the mouse.
