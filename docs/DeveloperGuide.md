## Introduction
### Purpose
This document describes the architecture and software design for the Professor Assistant Console, PAC.

### Target user profile
Our target audiences are professors who need help organizing their personal work schedule and need more time.
The professors are pressed for time and they require a simple software to organize their monthly events
and keep track of their students' attendance and performance. 

### Value proposition
Our application will reduce the stress of the professor by allowing them to easily enter and store
their work schedule as well as their students' records. After storing the data, the Professor can have
quick access to the information in either a list or a calendar view. 

### Audience 
The design documentation is in general for anyone who wants to understand the system architecture and design of 
PAC. The following groups are in particular the intended audience of the document.
- PAC project managers
- PAC developers
- PAC software testers
