### Target user profile
Our target audiences are professors who need help organizing their personal work schedule and need more time.
The professors are pressed for time and they require a simple software to organize their monthly events
and keep track of their students' attendance and performance. 

### Value proposition
Our application will reduce the stress of the professor by allowing them to easily enter and store
their work schedule as well as their students' records. After storing the data, the Professor can have
quick access to the information in either a list or a calendar view. 

### Audience 
The design documentation is in general for anyone who wants to understand the system architecture and design of 
PAC. The following groups are in particular the intended audience of the document.
- PAC project managers
- PAC developers
- PAC software testers

## Feature Design and Implementation 
### Event
![event](images/event.png "Class diagram of Event component")

*Class diagram of the Event component*

1. When a user enters an event-related command, the command is analysed by `EventCommandInterpreter`. 
1. Once determined, the relevant information (e.g. index, name, time, date, venue) are extracted by 
`EventParser`.
1. Then, the relevant class that corresponds to the command is created, with the information extracted 
from the previous step passed into it. It modifies `Event` or `EventList`.
1. These commands are then returned to `Duke.run()` to `execute()`. 

Note that:
* `datetime` is stored as a single attribute in `Event` class, but it is exposed to user as `date` 
and `time`, which corresponds to `d/` and `t/` flag respectively.
* `editDate` or `editTime` commands are not available. Only `editDateTime` is available to change the 
`date` and/or `time` of an `Event` object.
* `delete(Event)` method is currently not in use, but can be used to implement delete by event name, 
either by complete match, or fuzzy match.
* Any classes (e.g. `Seminar`) that inherit from `Event` class will have similar control flow. 

### Attendance Tracker
*Class diagram of the Attendance component*
1. When a user enters an attendance-related command, the command is analysed by `AttendanceCommandInterpreter`. 
1. Once determined, the relevant class that corresponds to the type of command is created.
1. Then, the class will execute base on its function. It modifies `AttendanceList`.
1. These commands are then returned to `Duke.run()` to `execute()`. 

Note that:
* `attendance add` command requires a line-by-line insertion of the student attendance data. 
The user is given an option to either use an existing list stored under StudentListCollection or
create a new attendance list. `n/` and `p/` flags are used to insert new attendance.

### Performance Tracker
*Class diagram of the Performance component*

### Student List Collection
*Class diagram of the Student List component*
1. When a user enters a studentList-related command, the command is analysed by `StudentCommandInterpreter`.
1. Once determined, the relevant class that corresponds to the type of command is created.
1. Then, the class will execute base on its function. It modifies `studentListCollection`.
1. These commands are then returned to `Duke.run()` to `execute()`.

Note that:
* To create a new studentList use `student add`. The new studentList will be added to the existing studentLists
that is stored inside the studentListCollection in chronological order of when it is created. 
* To view all existing studentList in studentListCollection use `student list`
*
